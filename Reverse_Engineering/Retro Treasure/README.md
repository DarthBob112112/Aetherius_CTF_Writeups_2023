#  Retro Treasure 

My grandfather gifted me this special disk when he passed away and told me that "Treecko will always be my favourite". Unfortunately, while thinking about his bizzare statement, I left the disk under the sun for too long and I suspect that a thick solar flare might have corrupted a byte on it. I promise to let you keep the contents of the disk, if you help me fix it.
